My implementation of the second exercise of the COMP4300 Game Programming Course by Dave Churchill.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ugbLQlw_VM&t=958s]
I am doing this on my own since the full course is available on youtube.
Using IMGUI and SFML, in this exercise I am tasked to create a small, fully fleged asteroids-like game that implements a small Entity Component System.
The user will be able to access a debug interface implemented with IMGUI.
